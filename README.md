### Sample Data
1. For the participants and company, they are created via the admin identity. Please copy & paste the data directly to create via the "Create new participant".

2. Not sure how we want to create the new participants, for now the rating needs to be created manually to match the id.
  a. Moving forward: Maybe the admin will create the new identity for new participants via transactions to help automate certain creation of the relevant assets 

### Network Cards
They are the identity/persona to use when testing/using the transactions. Please import them into your network.
